Ok, I thought the TODO reference was sufficient but I'll expand on it.

It seems  I have been a victim of the abuse usage while looking for 
platform_device references in the codebase. I'm working on a new 
approach for this.

Currently (as per the linux-next branch), the vchiq driver will happily 
carry on if any of the child  platform device registration fails. That 
means if bcm2835-audio fails to register, bcm2835-camera will  still 
kept registered I suppose.

However with usage of platform_add_devices() in this patch, I introduced 
a functionality change (I'm realizing this now) - any failure of child 
platform device registeration will -unregister- all the other platform 
devices i.e. if bcm2835-audio fails, bcm2835-camera will also get 
unregistered.

Should I be working towards the status-quo behavior ? Or it's sane to 
unregistered other platform devices if one of the fails like 
platform_add_devices() does ? (This affects my new approach as well, 
hence the question)

Not sure if this is a helpful comment, but as far I know, there can be 
vchiq child platform devices which probably don't have a Device tree 
entry. like the bcm2835-isp [1] I posted earlier.
