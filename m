Also they are userspace ABI.  Admittedly this is in staging and that
ABI is completely none compliant with IIO standards, but none the less
you should be very very careful when making that sort of change.

This driver needs a mass of work to drag it into the modern age.
IIRC there have been a few partial attempts at that in the past.
One key part of that is most of what you are touching in this
patch is in code that will not exist after this is modernized.

I'd be surprised if there is low hanging fruit like this that actually
makes sense to do in the remaining staging/iio drivers. 
Mostly much more radical surgery is required.

Anyhow, with that all in mind I'm not planning to take this sort
of change to this driver
