I think we could also use regmap_raw_write().

Agreed. We can start experimenting with this, and if somebody has use
cases outside of the camera sensor drivers space, we could later move
those helpers to regmap.

If this was the only issue to handle when porting drivers to mainline
and upstreaming them, I'd be happy :-)

Did you mean "not going to scale very well" ? I'm not sure to understand
what you mean here.
