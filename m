Right, and the part of the hardware that accesses the memory is called
a DMA engine.

I think we need to clarify what you mean by DMA engine. If it's
basically a standalone hardware block that does the DMA for another
hardware block, i.e. such as the standalone DMA engines under
drivers/dma, then I'd like to ask what the relation is between using
an external DMA engine and min_buffers_needed.

In theory that could work too, so hopefully we can achieve that. Some
drivers may not have very active maintainers... And other maintainers
who never worked with such drivers are as suited to read the code and
guess the expected state as you. That said, let's make sure that
everyone involved does their best, without pushing the task around.
