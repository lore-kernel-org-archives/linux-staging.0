I believe the list is fine, but I was enquiring if there were anymore
additional tasks above the scope listed in
drivers/staging/vc04_services/interface/TODO which are required. I don't
think you need to send a patch for the task above - unless there are a
lot more tasks required, or it becomes too much to do now.

The goal is to get the ISP upstream to support libcamera, and it would
help to know how deep the rabbit hole really is ;-)
