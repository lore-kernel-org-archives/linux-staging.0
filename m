You mean change the comment something like this:

 * Note this code uses the same DSM GUID as the int3472_gpio_guid in
 * the INT3472 discrete.c code and there is some overlap, but there are
 * enough differences that it is difficult to share the code.

I guess, where int3472_gpio_guid comes from:

drivers/platform/x86/intel/int3472/discrete.c:

static const guid_t int3472_gpio_guid =
        GUID_INIT(0x79234640, 0x9e10, 0x4fea,
                  0xa5, 0xc1, 0xb5, 0xaa, 0x8b, 0x19, 0x75, 0x6f);


?

The only way this can fail is with -ENOMEM (we already know dev
has an ACPI companion) and generally speaking the rule is to
not log errors for ENOMEM since when we hit that the kernel
already complains loudly before returning from the alloc call.

Thank you for the review!

I agree with all your other points and I'll address them
in the next version.

The kernel doc being here is modeled after newer (less old)
v4l2 APIs like include/media/v4l2-fwnode.h and
include/media/v4l2-async.h which all also have this in the header.

So unless the v4l2 folks want me to change this I'm going to keep
the kernel docs in the header.

(more in general I have seen both header and next to the body
placements for these kernel docs in various places in the kernel)

Regards,

Hans
