In general the number of lanes used is dependent on a particular board, and
in many cases the same sensor is used on different systems with a different
lane configuration. This might not happen on sensors used with atomisp but
it probably already happens on those used by the CIO2 (ov8865).

What the drivers should do and in most cases do is that they check the lane
configuration is valid for the device.

On sensors the number of lanes is practically never selected dynamically,
it's simply a property of the board (the CSI-2 receiver and how many wires
happen to be connected, whichever has fewer lanes).

The other, somewhat cleaner in my opinion and clearly more future-proof,
would be to return -EPROBE_DEFER if there are no endpoints. Which is also
what the ov8865 driver does already.

In the long run such bridge code could hopefully live in the ACPI framework
itself. Then we would have no probe ordering issues anymore. But that's
probably not going to happen for quite a while.
