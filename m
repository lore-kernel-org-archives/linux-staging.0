I cannot say anything about the media subsystem, but for networking
patches, i will be much more willing to help somebody going from
Outreach to being a full kernel developers if they decide to take on
something more than just some Coccinelle changes. If it looks like you
have the hardware and want to make it better, have a vision where the
driver should go, then you are likely to get more help from me. So if
media drivers are what you interested in, go buy some hardware which
uses one of the drivers in staging, look at the TODO file, and submit
bigger patches than just -1 to -ENOMEM.
