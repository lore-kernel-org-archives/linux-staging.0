We could but given that is custom ABI anyway, what is the advantage over
per symbol controls?  Generally 'mux' control sysfs attributes are harder
to use than separate files.  For starters you'd also need an
out_outvoltageX_symbolcount or something like that to know what values
can be used.  One file per symbol and that is explicit without yet
more descriptive ABI needing to be defined.

and the earlier versions of that series.

The challenge has always been the ABI for these.
We need to work out what it should be (which is kind of what Rodrigo is doi=
ng
in his RFCs) before we commit it in stone.  Whilst not ideal, we can evolve
an ABI for a driver in staging (for IIO anyway - be careful in other places)
but not once it is out of staging.
