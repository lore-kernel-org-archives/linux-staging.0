The instantiation of the sensor i2c_clients and of the atomisp PCI device
is independent of each other. In my other patch series I'm moving sensor
registration for atomisp over to the v4l2-async framework like all other
bridge/ISP drivers use so that atomisp no longer needs special sensor
drivers.

And AFAIK one of the reasons for having the v4l2-async framework is
to avoid needing to have a specific probe order between bridge vs
sensor drivers.

> Could this code live in the atomisp bridge instead?

That does not solve the probe ordering problem the sensor drivers
need the GPIOs to enable the sensor and they all enable the sensor
in their probe() to check the hw-id. The sensor's probe() function
runs without any ordering guarantees vs the ISP/brige's probe()
function. This is not an issue because at least during probe()
the sensor drivers don't have any interactions with the bridge
and any further access to the sensor-drivers is delayed until
the v4l2-async notifier completion callback has run.

The only way to work around the probe-ordering problem would
be to delay checking the hw-id until the sensor gets linked
to the bridge. Which would mean registering an async notifier
from the sensors to catch binding from the sensor drivers
and allowing the binding to fail.

Delaying the hw-id check like this would be much more involved
then the currently proposed solution and will likely cause
other issues like the wrong driver binding when hw-vendors
get the ACPI hw-id wrong (this is a known issue with audio-codecs,
so chances are we will see this with sensors too).

There are no trivial ways to avoid this. Period, full stop. I have
been looking into this for quite some time now and this really is
the easiest solution.

I cannot help but feel that you are blocking progress here purely
because you have a very dt centric view. I've done my best to make
the changes as non-invasive as possible and I must say I'm quite
unhappy about the in my eyes unnecessary and unproductive push back
here. I say unproductive because you have not offered any workable
alternatives yet.

Please keep in mind that the atomisp work I do is a volunteer /
side project, so as such I have limited time to invest in this and
I must say that your in my eyes unproductive unnecessary push back
is not helping with my motivation for this.

Also I'm basically fixing a mess here which Intel has left behind by
never properly doing hw-enablement for this...

Regards,

Hans
