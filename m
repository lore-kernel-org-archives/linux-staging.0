I've seen other sensors (in particular the AR0830) that also combine
analogue and digital gains in a single register. The analogue gain is
typically quite coarse in that case, and the digital gain is used for
fine adjustments. In the ar0830 driver I'm writing, I've split the two
components in two separate controls.
