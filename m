TBH this just feels like code obfuscation to me and it is also going
to write havoc with various smarted code-editors / IDEs which give
proptype info to the user while typing the function name.

Having the extra ", NULL" there in calls which don't use / need
the *err thingie really is not a big deal IMHO.

Hans
